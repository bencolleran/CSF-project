# CSF-project

# This project was an investigation into the Electronic Structure of Fe2-S2 clusters, using Configuration State Functions. We tested the hypothesis that the electron wavefunction could be broadly described by a small number of the CSFs, using a model hamiltonian from the paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2041 . To use this code, please download the CSFtools, GNME and other files, with the Tests folder being optional.
